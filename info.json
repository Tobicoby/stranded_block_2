You still need military to clear nearby island to expand. Incompatible with mods that adds some kind of new ore patches, but you can just add that in the recipe.lua yourself.\nSpace Age planets are not affected\nSome weird enemy bases :D\nBEWARE: I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMER/SCRIPTER\nOriginal made by Vectorinox"
